# CI verification status (P8)

The P8 CI skeleton (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, commit `eea4eed`) cannot yet
run remotely — the push carrying it is blocked (see "Remote blocker" below).
Until the blocker clears, this document is the P8 acceptance evidence: every
lane's exact command was executed locally on the pinned toolchain, from the
committed tree.

## Local lane-equivalent verification — 2026-07-27

Environment:

- Host: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (Linux)
- Toolchain: **1.92.0**, selected by `rust-toolchain.toml` (verified:
  `rustup show active-toolchain` → `1.92.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  (overridden by '/home/deb/Documents/code0/rust-toolchain.toml')`)
- `rustc 1.92.0 (ded5c06cf 2025-12-08)`, `cargo 1.92.0 (344c4567c 2025-10-21)`
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed for 1.92.0 (from the toolchain
  file's `targets` list)
- Tree: commit `eea4eed` ("P8: CI skeleton — …"), working tree clean

| Lane | Exact command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fmt` | `cargo fmt --check` | **PASS** (exit 0) |
| `clippy` | `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` | **PASS** (exit 0) |
| `test` | `cargo test --workspace --locked` | **PASS** (exit 0; all workspace unit + doc tests green, incl. the scaffold `version_matches_scaffold` tests) |
| `wasm32-core` | `cargo build -p antseal-core --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked` | **PASS** (exit 0) |
| `core-dep-graph` | the `Assert antseal-core normal deps are I/O-free` script from `ci.yml`, executed verbatim | **PASS** (exit 0; `cargo tree -p antseal-core -e normal` = `antseal-core v0.0.0` only; script printed `OK: antseal-core normal dep graph is free of forbidden crates.`) |

### Workflow-file sanity check

`actionlint` is not installed on this machine; stand-ins used instead:

- **Structural parse** (PyYAML): file parses; triggers = `pull_request` +
  `push` on `main`; `permissions: contents: read`; five jobs
  (`fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, `wasm32-core`, `core-dep-graph`), each
  `checkout@v4` → rustup-from-toolchain-file → `rust-cache@v2` → lane command.
- **Script execution**: the `core-dep-graph` shell script was run verbatim
  locally (table above) — stronger evidence than lint for the only
  non-trivial script in the file.
- **Manual read**: no hardcoded toolchain version anywhere
  (`grep '1\.92' ci.yml` → no matches — the toolchain comes exclusively from
  `rust-toolchain.toml`); `--locked` present in every dependency-resolving
  lane; jobs are small named units per the documented extension-point
  contract (Q1/Q5/Q9/Q31/P13/P14).
- Run `actionlint` once as part of the post-unblock steps below (it is
  available prebuilt or via `go install`; not blocking).

**Conclusion: all five lanes green locally on the pinned toolchain,
2026-07-27.** This is lane-equivalent evidence only; the P8 acceptance items
that inherently need the remote provider (runs on PR + default branch, cache
behavior on the runners, the red-lane probe) remain pending below.

## Remote blocker — push rejected without `workflow` scope

`origin` (`https://github.com/aed900/antseal.git`) is 1 commit behind
local `main`: the P8 commit `eea4eed` adds `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and
GitHub rejects pushes that create or update workflow files from credentials
lacking the `workflow` OAuth scope:

```
refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow ... without workflow scope
```

Both available `gh` tokens lack that scope. This is user-blocked — no push
can succeed until the maintainer re-authorizes.

**Unblock procedure (maintainer, interactive):**

1. `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow` — device flow; grants the
   `workflow` scope to the existing token.
2. `git push origin main`

## Pending P8 acceptance steps (execute post-unblock)

1. **Green run on `main`**: after the push, confirm the `ci` workflow runs
   on `main` and all five lanes pass. Record the run URL here:
   - main run: _(pending)_
2. **Red-lane probe** (P8 accept: "wasm32 lane demonstrably fails when a
   non-WASM dep is added to antseal-core — verified once with a throwaway
   commit"). Procedure:
   1. `git switch -c ci-probe/wasm-guard`
   2. Add a WASM-hostile dep that is also on the forbidden-crate list to
      `crates/antseal-core/Cargo.toml`, e.g.
      `tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt", "net"] }` (probe-only
      exception to the workspace-dependencies rule — this commit is
      throwaway and never merges).
   3. `cargo check -p antseal-core` to update `Cargo.lock`, and commit both
      files — otherwise every `--locked` lane fails on lockfile drift and
      muddies the probe signal.
   4. Push the branch and **open a draft PR** — required to trigger CI: the
      workflow runs on `pull_request` and on push to `main` only; a bare
      branch push starts nothing.
   5. Confirm BOTH probe-target lanes fail, each for its own reason:
      - `wasm32-core` — compile failure (`mio`/`socket2` do not build for
        `wasm32-unknown-unknown`);
      - `core-dep-graph` — script failure naming `tokio`, `mio`, `socket2`
        as offenders.
      `fmt`/`clippy`/`test` should stay green (sharpens the signal).
   6. Record both failing run URLs here, then close the PR (never merge) and
      delete the branch.
   - wasm32-core failing run: _(pending)_
   - core-dep-graph failing run: _(pending)_
3. Run `actionlint` against `.github/workflows/ci.yml` once and note the
   result here: _(pending)_
